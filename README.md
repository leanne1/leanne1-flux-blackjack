## Game play

### Game objective
- Blackjack is played with an international 52-card deck without jokers
- The game is played between a dealer and a single player
- The aim of the game is for the player to accumulate a higher point total than the dealer, but without going over 21 points. The player computes their score by adding the values of their individual cards.

### Card values
- The cards 2 to 10 have their face value, Jack, Queen, and King are worth 10 points each, and the Ace is worth either 1 or 11 points (player's choice).

### The game
- At the start of a blackjack game, the player and the dealer receive two cards each. The player's cards are normally dealt face up, while the dealer has one face down (hidden from the player) and one face up.
- The best possible blackjack hand is an opening deal of an ace with any ten-point card. This is called a "blackjack", or a natural 21, and if the player holds this s/he automatically wins unless the dealer also has a blackjack.
- After the cards have been dealt (and if the player does not have a blackjack) the player must choose to either keep their hand as it is ('stand') or take more cards from the deck ('hit'), one at a time, until either the player judges that the hand is strong enough to go up against the dealer's hand and stands, or until it goes over 21, in which case the player immediately loses ('busts'). The player can take as many cards as s/he likes, as long as they don't bust.
- Once the player has decided to stand or has busted, the dealer turns over their second hidden card.
- If the dealer has a natural 21 (blackjack) then the player loses, unless the player also has a blackjack, in which case the games ends as a draw.
- If the dealer doesn't have a blackjack, the dealer hits (takes more cards) or stands depending on the value of the hand. Contrary to the player, the dealer's action is completely dictated by the rules. The dealer must hit if the value of the hand is lower than 17, otherwise the dealer will stand.
- If the dealer goes bust the player wins. Otherwise if the player has a higher point total than the dealer the player wins. If the player has a lower point total than the dealer the dealer wins. If the player and dealer have the same point total the game is a draw.
